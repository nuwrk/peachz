Storing metadata in a public and untamperable location for over 200 years is crucial for several reasons:

Data Integrity:

Ensures the authenticity and accuracy of the metadata over time.
Prevents any unauthorized modifications, protecting the interests of artists and contributors.
Transparency:

Provides a transparent and verifiable record of song metadata.
Allows anyone to independently verify the details, promoting trust and accountability.
Historical Record:

Creates a permanent historical archive of musical contributions.
Ensures that the cultural and creative legacy is preserved for future generations.
Licensing and Royalties:

Facilitates accurate licensing and royalty distribution by maintaining an immutable record of all contributors.
Helps in resolving disputes by providing a clear and unalterable reference.
Technological Longevity:

Utilizes advanced blockchain technology to ensure data remains accessible and intact for centuries.
Adapts to future technological changes while maintaining the integrity of the stored data.
Censorship Resistance:

Prevents any single entity from censoring or altering the stored metadata.
Guarantees that the data remains accessible to anyone, regardless of political or economic pressures.
